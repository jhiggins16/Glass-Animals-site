<p class="reportp">James Higgins Web Authoring Assessment 1 <br>Student number:15620181 <br>Website URL: https://jhiggins16.github.io/Glass-Animals-site/
<br><br>Introduction:<br><br>
For the CMP1130M Web Authoring assignment I was tasked with creating an interactive and responsive website whilst also reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of current web standards and specifications. I also looked at how these standards compared to previous standards and how they have improved creator’s ability to make a website.  The website for this assessment was created with the consideration of the current web 
standards and specification to end up with a fully functioning site. Also, this website was created using the most recent markup language, 
this being HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript/jQuery were also used to turn HTML content into a presentable website.

<br><br>Web standards and specifications:<br><br>
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is a group of people who are involved in creating the web standards. These standards are designed to “ensure the long-term growth of the Web” [1].
 There are many standards that are laid out by the W3C, one of which is that the W3C encourages the use of the latest versions of HTML and CSS (being HTML5 and CSS3). HTML is used for 
 creating the structure for the page whereas CSS creates the layout of the pages and ensures the website can work on multiple devices and browsers for maximum interoperability for the website [2] The advantages 
 of this standard are that it provides a simple system for website creation as a specific set of languages are used to create the site. These languages have also been created to be able to operate in multiple browsers and their different versions. However, some aspects of the languages will not operate in specific browsers and therefore will require more effort from the programmer to ensure that
 the website runs smoothly on as many browsers as possible. HTML5 is an improvement from HTML4 because it introduced lots of semantic elements that made understanding the language easier for developers. HTML5 also introduced more support for a variety of browsers which meant that more people can use and access websites. [4]

 <br><br>Example of HTML5 being used<br><br>

 <br><br>
 One of the most debated standards is about privacy. This standard ensures that if the user wants or needs that, their data is kept private and fragmented [3]. One way of respecting the user’s privacy is that when geolocation is used by the site, the page asks the user for their consent to use their current location. This allows the user to feel safe when browsing sites and secure sites will attract more traffic as user’s 
 will trust the site and be happy to visit it. However, this means that the developer will have to incorporate tools to request the information from the user and provide alternative solutions for when the user does not wish to disclose their information which will take up more time.HTML5 does not really offer a security benefit over HTML4, this is because the local storage implemented instead of cookies can be accessed in 
 the same way which means that the information the website collects is as secure as local storage as it is as cookies.
 <br><br>
 Site asks user for location data

 <br><br>
 Another standard from the W3C is about web accessibility. The director of the W3C, Tim Berners-Lee states “The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.” This quote means that the web is designed to be used by everyone regardless of their hardware, software, location, language, or ability [5]. Accessibility is critical to website design as developers do
 not want to exclude anybody from using the site and its features. The advantages of this standard are that if a website is fully accessible to everybody then it will be more attractive to web users and will gain more traffic, and avoid any legal trouble as there are laws that ensure websites need to be accessible to users with disabilities. However, making a fully accessible website will require more effort from the
 programmer because they will need to implement the site with features that adhere to user with disabilities. HTML5 implemented a higher level of mobile support and a greater range of aesthetic options that make websites more accessible. HTML5 has increased it capabilities to run websites on less powerful phones which makes it more accessible as because with older technology can use sites. It also brought a larger range
 of fonts, styles, and colours which mean people with impaired vision can customise the site to make viewing it easier for them. [4]

 Interoperability:
 <br><br>
For the context of this assessment, interoperability means that the site can be used across multiple browsers and on mobile. To show the interoperability of my site I tested it in popular browsers and on mobile. I tested on Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, I found that all the websites loaded, and all the functionality was accessible. On mobile, the website loaded correctly and most of the functionality worked except for the drag and drop which isn’t supported on mobile. 
For my demo video I tested the website and its functionalities in Chrome, I did not have access to the other browsers but used a website testing site to get examples of my website on other browsers.

 <br><br>
 I couldn't test my last page on Safari as my trial for the testing software I was using ran out. But there is no reason why it shouldn't work
 <br><br>
 Improve interoperability:
 <br><br>
Although my site is quite interoperable, there are a couple of ways to improve it. Firstly, a more extensive use of webkits would allow my site to work on all browsers and versions making it fully interoperable, which would be very desirable. Also, adjusting my drag and drop to work on mobile would be another aspect to improve the site as it would be accessible to mobile users.
The main challenge for interoperability was making sure the website scaled down to mobile size. I managed this by using percentages to scale the objects, changed the layout for mobile and using fixed position to ensure the content did not run off the page.
<br><br>
W3C validation:
<br><br>
To validate my website, I used the W3C validator to check my code against web standards. I managed to achieve complete validation except for two errors and one warning. The errors came from me using images that were not resizable.

 Best practices:
 <br><br>
I tried to use the best practices when I was developing my site. I made my site mobile first using media queries when the screen got bigger. 
<br><br>
 <img src="Assets/Report/media.png" class="reportimg">
 <br><br>
 I also used commenting, so my code would be easier to understand.
